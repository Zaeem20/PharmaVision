If you develop swelling with amlodipine, tell your doctor right away because they may be able to change your blood pressure medications slightly to help reduce the swelling. Swelling caused by amlodipine does not usually respond to treatment with diuretics (such as furosemide) because it is caused by changes in capillary pressure that result in leakage into the spaces between capillaries (called the interstitial area) rather than water retention.</p>"

Weight gain with amlodipine may also be a symptom of edema, which is when you retain fluid, which may be particularly noticeable around your ankles or lower legs. The risk of edema is greater in women compared with men and in those people taking a higher dosage of amlodipine, and edema is usually noticed as weight gain.</p>"
